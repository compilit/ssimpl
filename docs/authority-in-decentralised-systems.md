# Authorities in Decentralised Identity Systems

It might seem counter-intuitive, why would there be a need for a trusted centralised party in a Decentralised identity
system?
This is simply because identity is non-deterministic. It is a social construct that is solely based on trust.

At birth, you have to trust that your parents/guardians take care to perform the correct steps to register you. During
your life you have to trust the authorities to take care of this identity, especially in the area of security. Given an
ever-changing world (consider the digital revolution), this is a huge undertaking.

In a Decentralised identity system, everybody is equal, as is their ability
to make claims about themselves. By introducing a central authority, everybody can agree that their judgment is the
correct one.
