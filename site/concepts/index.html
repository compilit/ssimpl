<h1 id="concepts">Concepts</h1>
<h2 id="1-bip">1. BIP</h2>
<p>BIP stands for Bitcoin Improvement Proposal — it’s a formal design document used to propose changes or additions to
Bitcoin’s protocol, processes, or tools.</p>
<p>It’s essentially the “RFC” (Request for Comments) system for Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Each BIP has:</p>
<ul>
<li>A number (e.g., BIP-39)</li>
<li>A type (Standards Track, Informational, or Process)</li>
<li>A status (Draft, Proposed, Final, etc.)</li>
<li>A detailed specification of the proposed change.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>BIP-32 defines hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets.</li>
<li>BIP-39 defines mnemonic phrases (seed words).</li>
<li>BIP-44 defines a multi-account wallet structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>While SSIMPL has nothing to do with Bitcoin, or even blockchains, it does rely upon some of the same concepts.</p>
<h2 id="11-bip32">1.1 BIP32</h2>
<p>BIP32 (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 32) defines Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets, which allow you to derive a
tree of key pairs from a single root seed.</p>
<p>Key features:</p>
<ul>
<li>One backup = all keys: Backing up the seed gives access to all derived keys.</li>
<li>Key separation: You can derive independent identities (child keys) without compromising the master.</li>
<li>Public derivation: Given a parent public key, you can derive child public keys (but not private keys).</li>
<li>Hardened derivation: A safer variant where child keys can’t be derived from public keys, but requires the parent
  private key.</li>
</ul>
<p>How it works:</p>
<p>You start with a single seed (often from a <a href="#12-bip39">BIP39</a> mnemonic).
From that seed, it deterministically derives a master keypair (private + public key).
Then you can derive child key pairs from the master, and children of those, forming a tree structure.</p>
<h2 id="12-bip39">1.2 BIP39</h2>
<p>BIP39 (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 39) defines a way to represent a deterministic wallet’s private key using a
human-readable set of words, called a mnemonic phrase.</p>
<p>Key properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mnemonic = backup: If you lose your device, you can recover your entire wallet using the phrase.</li>
<li>Language-agnostic: Wordlists exist for multiple languages.</li>
<li>Deterministic: The same phrase will always regenerate the same wallet.</li>
</ul>
<p>How it works:</p>
<p>First, a cryptographically strong random number (entropy) is generated. Then that number is converted into a sequence of
12–24 words chosen from a predefined list of 2048 words. Finally, this phrase can be used to derive a seed, which in
turn can generate a hierarchy of keys (e.g., via BIP32).</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="2-self-sovereign-identity">2. Self-Sovereign-Identity</h1>
<p>Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a Decentralised identity model where individuals control their own digital identities
without relying on central authorities.</p>
<p>The main issue which the concept SSI usually tends to ignore is 'truth'. As long an individual is in complete control of
their own digital identity, who is to say this individual is not impersonating some other individual, or worse,
conjuring up a completely new non-existing identity.</p>
<p>Cryptography can verify who issued a claim and whether it was tampered with, but it cannot verify the truthfulness of
the claim itself. The validity of claims like a name, nationality, or birthdate ultimately depends on who the issuer is
and whether they are trusted. However, since this requires authorities to be fully aligned with Web3 standards, we hit a
dead end. Currently, most (if not all) authorities don't have any way to issue a <a href="#3-did">DID</a>. So what SSIMPL does, is
reversing
the flow yet again: an individual can create their own DID along with the related cryptographic keys. Which is actually
in line with the entire idea of decentralisation. But 'claims' an individual makes are divided into 2 categories: formal
and informal.</p>
<h2 id="21-informal-claims">2.1 Informal Claims</h2>
<p>Informal claims can be made within certain scopes, where the user provides their own data along with their signature. By
nature, these claims cannot be verified by an authority. However, other identities can attest to a claim by signing it,
effectively endorsing its validity. This attestation carries moral responsibility, as the signer’s DID and signature
become publicly associated with the claim.</p>
<h2 id="22-formal-claims">2.2 Formal Claims</h2>
<p>Formal claims cannot be self-issued; they must come from a recognized authority. At this point in time, the only formal
claims available to a SSIMPL user, are the ones coming from their passport. These can be used to chain other claims of
course. For example: by taking your full name and birthdate, you can match then with the names and birthdate written on
an official
diploma.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="3-did">3. DID</h2>
<p>Decentralised IDentifier. A DID is a globally unique identifier that is not controlled by a central authority. Unlike
traditional identifiers (usernames, emails, etc.), a DID is linked to a cryptographic keypair, allowing users to prove
ownership without relying on a centralised system.</p>
<p>A DID follows this format:</p>
<pre><code>did:&lt;method&gt;:&lt;identifier&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In SSIMPL, primarily the 'key' method is used. This means that each 'identifier' part is actually the public part of a
specific cryptographic public/private keypair. Each user is responsible for their own private key, which is used to sign
data. The public key can always be used to verify the signature. The only small deviation from the spec is that
SSIMPL promotes the use of <a href="#7-multibase-encoding">Multibase encoding</a>, which means that even the public key part of the
DID is multibase-encoded.</p>
<p>The 'key' method also means there is no real need for a DID document, which is part of the DID spec.</p>
<h1 id="4-european-e-passports">4. European e-Passports</h1>
<p>A European e-passport relies on a set of international standards to prove its authenticity and integrity using
cryptographic techniques. These standards work together to ensure the data on the passport is both verifiable and
resistant to tampering or cloning. These passports contain cryptographic material used to verify the legitimacy of the
passport, thereby delegating the authority of the identity represented to
the bearer—assuming basic checks are met (e.g., does the bearer match the photo?).</p>
<h2 id="41-icao-doc-9303">4.1 ICAO Doc 9303</h2>
<p>The foundational specification for Machine Readable Travel Documents (MRTDs). It defines:</p>
<ul>
<li>The structure and contents of the e-passport chip.</li>
<li>Cryptographic protocols such as:<ul>
<li><strong>Passive Authentication (PA):</strong> Verifies the integrity and authenticity of the stored data using digital
  signatures from the issuing authority.</li>
<li><strong>Active Authentication (AA):</strong> Ensures the chip hasn’t been cloned by using a private key challenge/response
  protocol.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="42-isoiec-7816-parts-4-8-9">4.2  ISO/IEC 7816 (Parts 4, 8, 9)</h2>
<p>Standards for electronic identification cards with contacts, adapted for contactless chips in e-passports:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Part 4:</strong> File system structure and command set (APDUs).</li>
<li><strong>Part 8:</strong> Security-related functions including authentication.</li>
<li><strong>Part 9:</strong> Access control and secure messaging.</li>
</ul>
<p>These standards allow secure and standardized access to the data groups (DG1–DG15) on the chip.</p>
<h2 id="43-isoiec-14443-parts-14">4.3 ISO/IEC 14443 (Parts 1–4)</h2>
<p>Defines the physical and communication characteristics for contactless smartcards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enables NFC communication between passport chips and readers.</li>
<li>Standard across all ICAO-compliant e-passports.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="44-isoiec-7501-1">4.4 ISO/IEC 7501-1</h2>
<p>Specifies the physical format and layout of machine-readable passports, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dimensions</li>
<li>Data placement</li>
<li>The Machine Readable Zone (MRZ), which is used to derive keys for secure access (e.g., Basic Access Control).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="45-csca-and-dsc-certificates">4.5 CSCA and DSC Certificates</h2>
<p>Each country operates a <strong>Country Signing Certificate Authority (CSCA)</strong> and issues <strong>Document Signer Certificates (
DSCs)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The CSCA’s public key is distributed globally.</li>
<li>The DSC signs the data on each passport.</li>
<li>Verifiers use the CSCA chain to validate the DSC signature and ensure the data’s authenticity.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Together, these standards form the cryptographic backbone that allows e-passports to be trusted across borders.</p>
<h1 id="5-ucan-user-controlled-authorization-networks">5. UCAN - User Controlled Authorization Networks</h1>
<p>To align with Web3 standards, SSIMPL has adopted UCAN. UCAN challenges the traditional client-server model, shifting
control to the client.</p>
<p>Clients generate their own JWTs, specifying the request and resource they intend to access. Each JWT is signed with the
user’s private key, allowing the server to verify the signature and determine whether access should be granted. This
essentially reverses the OAuth 2.0 flow, where clients request a server-issued JWT with specific scopes.</p>
<p>It should be noted that UCAN was originally designed for "delegated authorization". Meaning, an issuer creates a token
that allows the bearer of the token to perform certain actions on certain resources. For authentication, an addition is
required.</p>
<h2 id="51-delegated-signing-using-ucan">5.1 Delegated signing using UCAN</h2>
<p>By creating a dedicated, short-lived and identity-bound token (by setting receivers' DID as the audience of the token),
a user can delegate signing authority towards another
entity, like the website they are currently on. The UCAN token is then embedded in the signature JWT in the prf-array.
This is relevant if the user is adding content to the website and the
website wants to have this content bound to a DID.</p>
<p>The implications are that all content on the internet HAS to be tied to an author, producer, etc. Which means that
fraudulent content, like non-consensual, AI-generated media, will have to signed as well.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="6-cryptography">6. Cryptography</h1>
<p>Achieving true decentralization requires users to handle complex cryptographic operations. To make this accessible, all
cryptographic functionality should be encapsulated within a user-friendly interface — a ‘wallet’.</p>
<p>This wallet contains at least one cryptographic keypair:</p>
<ol>
<li>A root AES key for encrypting and decrypting the user’s data.</li>
<li>An EC-based public/private key pair for signing and verifying data.</li>
</ol>
<p>These algorithms are widely recognized standards, so I won’t delve into their inner workings—Wikipedia is your friend
for that.</p>
<p>With these keys, users can encrypt, decrypt, sign, and verify data entirely on the client side, ensuring full control
over their information.</p>
<p>In the subscription system, an additional key pair is introduced. This keypair facilitates sharing a derived
AES key—not the root AES key, but a deterministically generated AES key unique to each subscription.</p>
<h2 id="61-post-quantum-disclaimer">6.1 Post-Quantum disclaimer</h2>
<p>With the inevitable advent of quantum computing, these algorithms will change eventually. Currently, there are several
candidates which could potentially take over the aforementioned algorithms. SSIMPL will adopt them as soon as they are
ripe.</p>
<p>The biggest concern lies in asymmetric encryption, which is used for signing and sharing of secrets. Through Shor's
algorithm, the asymmetric encryption algorithms we currently rely on will be cracked, meaning that private keys can
be derived based on public keys. This is why everything related to asymmetric encryption should have an expiration
time.</p>
<p>The other concern is in the symmetric encryption, for which exclusively AES is used. SSIMPL is already post-quantum
proof in this area, since it used AES-256. Which is overkill in the current day and time, but will be equivalent to
AES-128 when quantum computing becomes more prevalent.</p>
<h1 id="7-multibase-encoding">7. Multibase Encoding</h1>
<p>On the internet, a lot of raw data (bytes) is transported using something called base encoding. These encodings
essentially turn the raw bytes into a piece of transportable and near-readable text. But when you wish to access the raw
bytes again on the receiving side, you need to know which encoding was used in order to decode it. But there are a lot
of different encodings to choose from. This means that encoding and decoding must be well-documented. With Multibase
encoding, a special reserved character for each specific encoding is appended to the encoded value which indicates which
encoding was used. This means that anyone receiving the encoded bytes can always decode it. More can be read
